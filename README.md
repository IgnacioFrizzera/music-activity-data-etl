# song-similarity

project that aims to make a model that decides if two songs are similar or not based on different song attributes such as:
  - tempo
  - timbre
  - pitches
  - etc

also aiming to create datasets for some genres (rap, rock, dubstep) of similar known songs.


still trying to figure out most of this, so work in progress :)
